# wedge-check.sh -- prove each Mach service actually ANSWERS, and dump why not.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# A wedged daemon is invisible to everything we had. It has not crashed: it
# sits healthy and idle in ipc_mqueue_receive waiting for a request that never
# lands in its queue, so `launchctl list` reports status 0 for it indefinitely
# while every client blocks forever. On 2026-08-30 the box showed a completely
# clean `launchctl list` -- 13 jobs, all status 0 -- with syslog 100% dead.
#
# So liveness (the process exists) and health (status 0) are both worthless as
# evidence here. The only thing that proves a Mach service works is a BOUNDED
# round trip against it.
#
# Two rules this script exists to enforce
# ---------------------------------------
# 1. Every probe is bounded. An unbounded probe against a wedged service does
#    not fail, it hangs -- which is how this class of bug hid for so long.
# 2. A service with no probe reports UNPROBED, never PASS. Absence of evidence
#    must not read as success; that is the same mistake in a different place.
#
# On any WEDGED result the diagnostic bundle below is dumped automatically.
# It is exactly the set of facts that took a full day to assemble by hand:
# who is blocked, where in the kernel, and what the daemon last did.
#
# usage: wedge-check.sh [timeout_seconds]
# exit:  0 all probed services answered; 1 one or more wedged
#
