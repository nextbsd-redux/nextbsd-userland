/*
 * lease_loop.c — post-BOUND lease management. RFC 2131 §4.4.5
 * BOUND/RENEWING/REBINDING state-machine on the daemon's main
 * thread.
 *
 * Sleep is 1s-tick polling on `got_term` so SIGTERM shortens any
 * wait; the longest contiguous block call is sleep(1).
 *
 * iter 5b: lease_cap_secs (from IPCONFIGD_FAST_LEASE in env) caps
 * the effective lease time used to derive T1 / T2. Useful in CI
 * where SLIRP hands out 86400s leases that would otherwise mean
 * T1 = 12 hours; capping to e.g. 10s makes the renewal code run
 * within the boot-test budget. The cap is NOT applied to
 * lease->lease_time (the value sc_publish.c forwards to configd) —
 * downstream consumers see the server's authoritative value. iter
 * 5b also emits IPCFG-RENEW-OK once on the first successful
 * RENEWING/REBINDING ACK so the gate fires deterministically.
