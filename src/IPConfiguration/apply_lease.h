/*
 * apply_lease.h — install / remove a DHCPv4 lease on an interface.
 *
 * apply_lease() configures the interface address via SIOCAIFADDR and
 * installs the default route via the PF_ROUTE socket.
 *
 * deconfigure_lease() is its inverse, and it did not exist (#39). The
 * daemon installed an address and a default route and then never took
 * them back — not on link-down, not on lease expiry, not on interface
 * removal. Walk out of WLAN range and a dead IP plus a dead default
 * route stayed installed, silently blackholing traffic. There was no
 * SIOCDIFADDR and no RTM_DELETE anywhere in the tree.
 *
 * DNS is deliberately NOT handled per-interface. /etc/resolv.conf is
 * global state, so a per-interface writer means last-to-bind wins —
 * wlan0 would clobber the DNS of a wired em0 that outranks it.
 * resolv_conf_sync() instead regenerates the file from whichever
 * interface currently holds primary (bound_state_primary(), #41), and
 * is called after any bind or teardown. It also writes atomically
 * (temp + fsync + rename); the old in-place fopen("w") could be read
 * half-written.
