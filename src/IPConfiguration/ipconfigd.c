/*
 * ipconfigd — freebsd-launchd-mach IPConfiguration daemon.
 *
 * The Mach-IPC track port of Apple's IPConfiguration
 * (apple-oss-distributions/bootp / IPConfiguration.bproj). Apple
 * runs it as a configd plugin; we run standalone because this
 * repo's configd has no plugin loader (see [[configd-port-state]]
 * memory). Plan inventory + amputation list at
 * pkgdemon.github.io/nextbsd-ipconfiguration-plan.html.
 *
 * iter 1 — daemon skeleton. main + signal handling + getifaddrs
 * interface enumeration + bootstrap_check_in for
 * com.apple.IPConfiguration + a sleep loop that holds the service
 * port until SIGTERM. Marker IPCFG-BOOT-OK is emitted by the
 * separate `ipconfigtest` client (bootstrap_look_up against this
 * service) — same pattern hwregd / configd iter 1 use.
 *
 * iter 2 — one-shot DHCPv4 DISCOVER/OFFER probe (dhcp_discover.c).
 *
 * iter 3 — full RFC 2131 INIT → BOUND. dhcp_discover.c runs the
 * SELECTING → REQUESTING → BOUND state machine; apply_lease.c then
 * installs the result (SIOCAIFADDR, default route, /etc/resolv.conf).
 *
 * iter 4 — SCDynamicStore publish on BOUND + RFC 2131 §4.4.5
 * RENEWING/REBINDING lease loop. sc_publish.c builds the
 * State:/Network/Service/<UUID>/IPv4 dictionary; lease_loop.c
 * sleeps until T1, sends a broadcast RENEWING REQUEST, etc.
 *
 * iter 5a — raw mach_msg MIG demux + worker thread.
 * mach_service.c spawns a pthread that bootstrap_check_in's the
 * service port and runs _ipconfig_server() (MIG demux for
 * ipconfig.defs) on each request. The worker reads live state via
 * bound_state.{c,h}; each interface's DHCP worker writes it on BOUND.
 * iter 5a vendors 2 read-only routines (if_count, if_addr); the full
 * ipconfig.defs surface grows in iter 6+.
 *
 * link-state DHCP trigger — react to link-up via SCDynamicStore.
 * sc_link_watch.c watches State:/Network/Interface/<if>/Link, which
 * the standalone KernelEventMonitor daemon publishes from PF_ROUTE
 * link-state changes; when an interface goes Active the watch invokes
 * on_link_event(), which admin-ups it (link down) or starts a DHCP
 * worker (link up). This is the Apple-shaped trigger
 * (KernelEventMonitor -> SCDynamicStore -> IPConfiguration); it
 * replaced the earlier hwregd attach subscription (removed with hwregd
 * in PR #167). At startup we bring the candidate NIC IFF_UP so its link
 * negotiates, then let the watch fire DHCP — fixing the stock-kernel
 * case where a real NIC's link comes up a beat after a one-shot startup
 * scan would have given up.
 *
 * multi-interface (#37/#38/#39/#41) — the daemon was, structurally, a
 * single-interface wired-desktop daemon, and WLAN is what forced it to
 * grow up. Four bugs, all invisible while only ever one wired NIC was
 * exercised:
 *
 *   #38  exactly ONE interface could ever bind, for the daemon's whole
 *        lifetime — a global g_dhcp_started plus a global bound_state.
 *        There is now one worker slot and one lease-table entry per
 *        interface, so em0 and wlan0 bind independently.
 *   #37  the post-expiry re-arm was dead code: it cleared the in-flight
 *        flag but nothing ever cleared bound_state, so the next guard
 *        short-circuited and DHCP never ran again until restart. Workers
 *        now clear their own entry on teardown.
 *   #39  there was no deconfigure path at all — no SIOCDIFADDR, no
 *        RTM_DELETE anywhere. Walk out of WLAN range and the dead IP and
 *        dead default route stayed installed, blackholing traffic. A
 *        link-down now unwinds that interface's worker, which takes them
 *        back.
 *   #41  State:/Network/Global/IPv4 was last-binder-wins, so "primary
 *        interface" was a race between em0 and wlan0 — and both
 *        mDNSResponder and hostnamed read that key. Primary is now the
 *        highest-ranked bound interface (wired > wireless), re-elected
 *        on every bind and teardown; /etc/resolv.conf follows it.
