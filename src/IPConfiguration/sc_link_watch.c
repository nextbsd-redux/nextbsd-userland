/*
 * sc_link_watch.c — ipconfigd SCDynamicStore interface-state watcher.
 *
 * Watches State:/Network/Interface/<if>/Link (published by configd's
 * KernelEventMonitor from PF_ROUTE link-state changes) and, since the
 * WLAN work, State:/Network/Interface/<if>/AirPort (published by wland).
 * DHCP starts only when BOTH say go.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The DHCP gate (WLAN plan §1.4)
 *
 * ipconfigd's contract used to be "Link{Active} means L2 is usable for
 * IP". For Ethernet that is true. For 802.11 it is a lie, and the lie is
 * expensive:
 *
 *   net80211 reaches RUN state as soon as the station has ASSOCIATED —
 *   which is BEFORE the WPA 4-way handshake. The interface reports
 *   LINK_STATE_UP at that instant, KernelEventMonitor publishes
 *   Link{Active:true}, and ipconfigd fires DHCPDISCOVER onto a port that
 *   is not yet keyed. Every packet is dropped. The {4,8,16}s retransmit
 *   ladder burns ~28 seconds and gives up — and because Link is ALREADY
 *   Active, no new link event ever arrives, so nothing retries. Silence,
 *   forever.
 *
 * The repair is a second predicate: require Link{Active} AND
 * AirPort{Authenticated}. wland publishes AirPort{Authenticated:false}
 * on association and {Authenticated:true} on CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED.
 *
 * KEY-ABSENT-MEANS-READY IS THE LOAD-BEARING DEFAULT. No WLAN daemon has
 * claimed em0, so em0 has no AirPort key, so wlan_ready() returns 1 and
 * the wired path behaves bit-for-bit as it always has. That matters more
 * than it sounds: tests/boot-test.sh gates the whole CI on em0 getting a
 * lease, and this gate must be invisible to it.
 *
 * The re-trigger falls out for free. wland's second configset (false ->
 * true) is itself a change on the AirPort pattern, so configd wakes this
 * same session, evaluate_interface() re-runs, /Link is still Active, the
 * gate is now open, and DHCP starts. Event-driven; no polling, no
 * debounce, no new IPC, no configd change, no MIG regeneration.
 *
 * It also incidentally fixes the "one failed attempt then silence" hole
 * for WLAN: a re-association generates a fresh AirPort transition and
 * therefore a fresh trigger, even though /Link never moved.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Threading: the SC change callout runs on a dedicated serial delivery
 * queue (under SCDynamicStoreSetDispatchQueue). To keep that queue
 * free, the callout never runs DHCP itself — it dispatches each
 * link-up to the global concurrent queue, where the callback may block
 * in the DHCP + lease loop. The same scheduling path serves the
 * one-shot initial scan, so a link already Active before we subscribed
 * still fires. Concurrent/duplicate fires are the callback's problem
 * to dedupe (ipconfigd guards per-interface on its worker table).
 *
 * Single CF translation unit, like sc_publish.c — the rest of the
 * daemon stays plain C.
