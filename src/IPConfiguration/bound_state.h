/*
 * bound_state.h — thread-safe table of ipconfigd's currently-bound
 * DHCPv4 leases, one entry per interface.
 *
 * This was a single global holding one lease, which capped the daemon
 * at exactly one bound interface for its lifetime (#38) and — because
 * nothing ever cleared it — made the post-expiry re-arm dead code
 * (#37). It is now a small fixed table: each interface's DHCP worker
 * writes its own entry on BOUND and clears it on teardown, and the
 * Mach service thread reads across them. One mutex guards the whole
 * table; the access pattern is a couple of writers plus a low rate of
 * readers, so per-entry locking would buy nothing.
 *
 * The table also answers "who is primary?" (#41). State:/Network/
 * Global/IPv4 used to be last-binder-wins — whichever service bound
 * most recently declared itself primary — so on a laptop with em0 and
 * wlan0 the answer was a race. Primary is now the highest-ranked bound
 * interface by iface_rank(): wired beats wireless beats everything
 * else, which is macOS's default service order. Unplug the Ethernet
 * and wlan0 is promoted; plug it back in and em0 reclaims it. A
 * user-reorderable service list (Apple's real model, driven from
 * preferences.plist) can replace iface_rank() later without touching
 * a single caller.
