/*
 * vap.h — 802.11 PHY enumeration and VAP lifecycle.
 *
 * On FreeBSD an 802.11 driver does NOT present a usable network interface. The
 * driver registers a `struct ieee80211com` (the PHY — "iwlwifi0"), and you must
 * clone a Virtual AP off it to get something you can configure:
 *
 *     ifconfig wlan0 create wlandev iwlwifi0
 *
 * On stock FreeBSD that line lives in rc.conf (wlans_iwlwifi0="wlan0"). NextBSD
 * has no rc.conf and no /etc/rc.d, and never will — launchd is PID 1, and
 * nextbsd-freebsd-compat's build hard-strips /stage/etc. So the phy->VAP
 * lifecycle has NO OWNER, and that is one of the three things standing between
 * "Intel card" and "IP address".
 *
 * It is wland's, because wland is the only thing that knows when a radio should
 * have an interface at all. Note this is a responsibility Apple's wifid never
 * had: IO80211 presents en0 directly, with no VAP concept to manage.
