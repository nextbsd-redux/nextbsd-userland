/*
 * airport.h — wland's SystemConfiguration surface.
 *
 * Two jobs, both CoreFoundation, kept in one translation unit so the CF header
 * pull stays contained (same arrangement as ipconfigd's sc_publish.c — the rest
 * of the daemon is plain C).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. Publish State:/Network/Interface/<if>/AirPort
 *
 *      { Authenticated, SSID, BSSID, RSSI, Channel, Security }
 *
 * This key is THE contract of the whole WLAN design. ipconfigd's DHCP gate
 * requires Link{Active} AND AirPort{Authenticated} before it will send a
 * DHCPDISCOVER, because net80211 reports the link UP at ASSOCIATION — before the
 * WPA 4-way handshake — and DHCP onto an unauthenticated port is silently
 * dropped. Nothing else in the system publishes an association-complete signal,
 * which is precisely why the "cheap path" of skipping wland was rejected: there
 * would be nothing for the gate to gate on.
 *
 * We are INVENTING this schema. SCSchemaDefinitions.h stops at
 * IPv4/IPv6/DHCP/DNS/Proxies/Interface/Link — there is no kSCEntNetAirPort, so
 * the key and field names here are the definition, not a copy of one. They are
 * chosen to match what macOS uses so a future CoreWLAN-shaped layer sees a
 * familiar shape.
 *
 * ONLY the compact connected-state summary goes in the store. Scan results do
 * NOT: CONFIG_DATA_MAX (config_types.h:74) rejects any key OR value over 8192
 * bytes, and a busy scan blows straight past that. Scan results go over wland's
 * MIG surface instead (wlan.defs).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2. Known networks in SCPreferences
 *
 * SSID -> { PSK, Security, AutoJoin, LastUsed }, in the root-owned
 * preferences.plist under /Local/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration.
 * SCPreferences gives us atomic commit (temp file + rename) and a lockfile for
 * free.
 *
 * The PSK is PLAINTEXT. That is not a decision we get to make: there is no
 * keychain on NextBSD, it is not started, and it is not planned — so WLAN
 * passwords are plaintext-on-disk no matter which path we take. The only real
 * choice is WHICH plaintext file, and this one keeps wland the sole author of
 * wpa_supplicant's network blocks (see supplicant.h) instead of scattering
 * credentials into /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf where wpa_supplicant's own autojoin
 * would start competing with ours. When a real keychain lands, this is the one
 * function that changes. (WLAN plan Q2; see the Keychain plan for the option
 * space.)
