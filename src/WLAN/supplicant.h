/*
 * supplicant.h — wland's policy layer over stock wpa_supplicant.
 *
 * Owns, per WLAN interface: the two wpa_ctrl connections (command + event), the
 * scan-result cache, and the current association state.
 *
 * WLAND IS THE SOLE AUTHOR OF WPA_SUPPLICANT'S NETWORK BLOCKS. wpa_supplicant is
 * started with an EMPTY config and every network is injected at runtime via
 * ADD_NETWORK / SET_NETWORK / SELECT_NETWORK. This is not a stylistic choice: if
 * wpa_supplicant.conf ALSO carried SSIDs, then wpa_supplicant's own autojoin and
 * wland's autojoin would both be trying to pick a network, and they would fight.
 * That is the classic NetworkManager failure mode, and it produces exactly the
 * bug users hate — the machine keeps reconnecting to the wrong SSID and nothing
 * you click makes it stop. One brain. It is wland's.
 *
 * Known networks (SSID, PSK, autojoin, last-used) live in SCPreferences, not in
 * wpa_supplicant.conf — see airport.h. They are plaintext either way, because
 * there is no keychain and none is started; the only real choice is WHICH
 * plaintext file, and a root-owned preferences.plist is the Darwin-shaped one
 * and keeps wland the sole author. (WLAN plan Q2.)
