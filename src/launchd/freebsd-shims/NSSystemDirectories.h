/*
 * freebsd-launchd-mach (2026-05-15)
 *
 * Stub NSSystemDirectories for launchctl. Apple's launchctl uses
 * NSStartSearchPathEnumeration / NSGetNextSearchPathEnumeration to
 * walk the Library directory hierarchy (~/Library, /Local/Library,
 * /Network/Library, /System/Library) looking for LaunchAgents and
 * LaunchDaemons subdirs.
 *
 * Stub returns ONLY /Local/Library and /System/Library (per the
 * project install-layout spike: /Local/Library replaces Apple's
 * /Local/Library on this platform). Skips ~/Library (no per-user agent
 * support yet) and /Network/Library (no NetInfo / OD).
 *
 * The enumeration state is just an int counter:
 *   1 -> /Local/Library,  advance to 2
 *   2 -> /System/Library, advance to 3
 *   3 -> end (return 0, WITHOUT writing a path)
 *
 * The terminating call must not write a path. Apple's callers test the
 * return value before touching the buffer:
 *
 *     while ((es = NSGetNextSearchPathEnumeration(es, nspath))) { ... }
 *
 * so a call that fills 'path' and returns 0 has its path silently
 * dropped -- the loop exits before the body runs. Returning 0 on the
 * /System/Library step is what made `launchctl load -D all` search only
 * /Local/Library and never see the OS daemons.
 *
 * If a future task adds per-user agents, extend the table at the
 * bottom of this header.

 * Initialize enumeration.
 *
 * The MASK IS LOAD-BEARING and must be honoured. Apple's callers rely on an
 * empty mask producing an empty enumeration:
 *
 *     es = 0;                          // no -D given
 *     ... getopt sets bits only for -D ...
 *     es = NSStartSearchPathEnumeration(NSLibraryDirectory, es);

 *             strcat(nspath, "/LaunchDaemons");
 *             glob(nspath, ...);       // readpath() every plist found
 *     }
 *     for (i = 0; i < argc; i++) readpath(argv[i], &lus);
 *
 * So for `launchctl unload /path/to/one.plist` with no -D, mask is 0, the
 * loop body never runs, and only the named file is acted on.
 *
 * This stub previously ignored the mask and returned 1 unconditionally, so
 * the loop ALWAYS ran: every `launchctl load` or `unload` globbed both
 * LaunchDaemons directories and added EVERY plist on the system to the set.
 * `launchctl unload <one job>` therefore unloaded everything -- syslogd and
 * sshd included -- and took the machine down. Reproduced twice on hardware
 * before the cause was found (#113).
 *
 * Domains we can serve, and the step each maps to:
 *   NSLocalDomainMask  (2) -> /Local/Library
 *   NSSystemDomainMask (8) -> /System/Library
 *
 * NSUserDomainMask and NSNetworkDomainMask are not supported (no per-user
 * agents, no OD), and are simply absent from the walk rather than silently
 * substituted.
 *
 * The returned state encodes which steps remain, so an empty mask yields 0
 * and terminates immediately.
