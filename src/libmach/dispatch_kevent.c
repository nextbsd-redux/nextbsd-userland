/*
 * dispatch_kevent.c — libmach kevent_qos() + EVFILT_MACHPORT bridge.
 *
 * See <mach/dispatch_kevent.h> for the architecture rationale. Short
 * version: libmach provides a kevent_qos()-style entry point + a
 * widened kevent struct (kevent_qos_s with ext[4]) so libdispatch's
 * HAVE_MACH paths compile against Apple-shape APIs. The wrapper
 * translates kevent_qos_s ↔ FreeBSD's struct kevent at the
 * __sys_kevent boundary, intercepting EVFILT_MACHPORT registrations
 * and routing them to mach.ko's NATIVE EVFILT_MACHPORT kqueue filter
 * (slot -16) on a wrap port set. (Previously this used the
 * register_event_bell self-pipe bridge, task #39 Path B; the native
 * filter — proven in nextbsd#249 — delivers reliably, fixing the
 * task-#41 dropped-notification flakiness, and is the Apple-shape path.)
 * The filter is registered in notify mode (fflags = 0): filt_machport
 * signals readiness without consuming, and the wrapper drains the pset
 * via mach_msg into the per-registration backlog, exactly as before.
 *
 * Concurrency. A single global mutex protects the registration list.
 * The list is expected to stay small (a handful of dispatch_mach_t
 * channels + per-RPC reply ports), so linear search is fine.
 *
 * Limits in this first cut:
 *   - data_out / data_available (kevent_qos's data-buffer feature
 *     used by workloops) are accepted and ignored. No HAVE_MACH-
 *     non-workloop path in libdispatch exercises them.
 *   - ke->qos and ke->ext[2] (priority) are zeroed on synthesized
 *     events. Mach msg priority would come from msgh_voucher/trailer
 *     parsing — deferred to a follow-up.
 *   - kevent_qos's `flags` arg: IMMEDIATE forces zero timeout
 *     downward; WORKQ is ignored; ERROR_EVENTS isn't honored
 *     (errors surface via errno on the function return). libdispatch
 *     only passes these on submit-only calls where the difference
 *     doesn't matter.
 *
 * Buffer ownership. mach_msg() is called with MACH_RCV_LARGE; on
 * MACH_RCV_TOO_LARGE we re-malloc to the reported size and retry.
 * The synthesized event always carries DISPATCH_EV_MSG_NEEDS_FREE
 * (0x10000) in flags so _dispatch_kevent_mach_msg_drain() free()s
 * the buffer after consuming it.

		 * On a KEVENT_FLAG_ERROR_EVENTS call, emit receipts ONLY --

		 *
		 * libdispatch issues every registration and every EV_DISPATCH
		 * re-arm through _dispatch_kq_update_one(), which passes
		 * KEVENT_FLAG_IMMEDIATE | KEVENT_FLAG_ERROR_EVENTS
		 * (event_kevent.c) and an eventlist of 16 -- it wants receipts
		 * for the changes it submitted, nothing more. Its own
		 * EV_RECEIPT emulation is compiled out here because
		 * DISPATCH_USE_KEVENT_QOS is 1, so honouring "do not dequeue"
		 * is entirely on this wrapper.
		 *
		 * Phase 1 already honours it (see the guard at the drain
		 * above). Phase 3 did not: a readiness event arriving in the
		 * same call was drained with mach_msg -- taking the message
		 * OUT of the port set -- and handed up. libdispatch's
		 * ERROR_EVENTS loop keeps only entries with EV_ERROR set and
		 * silently discards the rest, so the message was destroyed,
		 * its buffer and any ports inside it leaked, and no retry was
		 * possible: the kernel had already dequeued it, so
		 * ipc_pset_signal() will never fire for it again.
		 *
		 * Two paths make that hot rather than rare. libdispatch sends
		 * before it registers the reply port (mach.c), so a fast local
		 * server's reply can be eaten by the very call registering
		 * interest in it -- client blocked in ipc_mqueue_receive,
		 * server healthy and idle, which is #78's signature exactly.
		 * And because every re-arm is also an ERROR_EVENTS call, this
		 * fires after every delivered message, not just at setup.
		 *
		 * Skipping the entry leaves the message queued, so the next
		 * ordinary poll delivers it -- but ONLY if the readiness knote is
		 * level-triggered, which is why it is now registered EV_ADD with
		 * no EV_CLEAR.
		 *
		 * It was EV_ADD | EV_CLEAR, and that made this skip silently lossy.
		 * With EV_CLEAR the kernel clears KN_ACTIVE | KN_QUEUED when it
		 * hands the event over (kern_event.c:2270), so the readiness is
		 * consumed by the very call that skips it. Nothing re-arms the
		 * knote -- ipc_pset_signal() only fires on a NEW enqueue -- so the
		 * message sits on the port until unrelated traffic signals the set
		 * again, and any client waiting for a reply hangs until then.
		 *
		 * Measured on the kernel side before this change: over four runs of
		 * 150 sends, userland was handed 919/901/906/901 "message waiting"
		 * notifications and performed 909/889/895/895 actual receives -- a
		 * persistent gap of 10/12/11/6, about 1% of notifications, never
		 * negative. aslmanager's service port holds an undelivered message
		 * from boot on every boot for the same reason: skipped once during
		 * registration, never signalled again. See nextbsd-userland#135 and
		 * nextbsd-kernel#145.
		 *
		 * Level-triggered is what this code always assumed. filt_machport
		 * returns non-zero while any member port holds a message, so kqueue
		 * re-queues the knote (kern_event.c:2273) and the next ordinary
		 * poll does deliver it. It cannot spin: ERROR_EVENTS calls are
		 * KEVENT_FLAG_IMMEDIATE and return at once anyway, and ordinary
		 * polls drain in Phase 3 below.
